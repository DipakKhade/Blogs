          WebRTC (Web Real-time Communication) is an industry effort to enhance the web browsing model. It allows browsers to directly exchange real-time media with other browsers in a peer-to-peer fashion through secure access to input peripherals like webcams and microphones.

        WebRTC (Web Real-time Communication) is an industry effort to enhance the web browsing model. It allows browsers to directly exchange realtime media with other browsers in a peer-to-peer fashion through secure access to input peripherals like webcams and microphones.

Traditional web architecture is based on the client-server paradigm, where a client sends an HTTP request to a server and gets a response containing the information requested. In contrast, WebRTC allows the exchange of data among N peers. In this exchange, peers talk to each other without a server in the middle.

WebRTC comes built-in with HTML 5, so you dont need a third-party software or plug-in to use it, and you can access it in your browser through the WebRTC API.

In this article, youll learn how and when to use WebRTC, and how it compares to the capabilities of WebSockets.

WebRTC use cases
As a technology, WebRTC has broad applicability. In this section, well cover different use cases where WebRTC is a good choice.

Peer-to-peer video, audio, and screen sharing
WebRTC was originally created to facilitate peer-to-peer communication over the internet, especially for video and audio calls. Its now used for more use cases, including text-based chats, file sharing, and screen sharing. WebRTC is used by products like Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack, and Google Meet. WebRTC has also found relevance in EdTech and healthcare.

File exchange
WebRTC can be used to share files in various formats, even without a video or audio connection. WebTorrent is an example of a file-sharing app built on top of the WebRTC architecture.

Internet of Things
IoT devices are embedded with software and sensors that make it possible to process data and exchange information with other devices on the internet or on a network. WebRTC is helpful when there is a need to send or receive data in real time. For instance, if a drone needs to send video or audio in realtime, WebRTC can make that possible.

Surveillance is another IoT example where WebRTC is a strong choice. Think of baby monitors, nanny cams, doorbells, and home cameras. In these scenarios, WebRTC makes it easy to stream video and audio information to smartphones and laptops.

Entertainment and audience engagement
WebRTC is used for entertainment and audience engagement, including augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming - for example, Googles gaming platform, Stadia, uses WebRTC under the hood.

Realtime language processing
Language processing involves live closed captions, transcriptions, and automatic translations. Through a combination of the HTML5 Speech API and WebRTCs data channels, transcripts can be sent cross-platform in realtime. A good example of this is seen in YouTube and Google Meets, where the closed captions are automatically generated on demand.

Key features of WebRTC
WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs. We will now look closely at some of the key ones: MediaStream, RTCPeerConnection, and RTCDataChannel.

More details about all WebRTC interfaces are available here.

MediaStream
The MediaStream interface is designed to let you access streams of media from local input devices like cameras and microphones. It serves as a way to manage actions on a data stream like recording, sending, resizing, and displaying the streams content. To use a media stream, the application must request access from the user through the getUserMedia method. Using this method, you can specify whether you need permission for only video, audio, or both.

To test this on a web page, you need a web server. Opening up an HTML file within the browser wont work because of the security and permission measures that dont allow it to connect to cameras or microphones unless its being served by an actual server. However, a simple Node.js server can help with this.

To get started, download and install Node.js. Then open up a terminal or command line interface and type npm install -g node-static. Its now easy for you to serve a static file. Now you can navigate to any directory that contains the HTML files you want to host on the server.
